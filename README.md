# Star-Classification-using-Machine-Learning 
Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP). 
Key highlights:
- Studied and Analyzed the Stellar Classification  dataset to applying ML models and present my insights. 
- Performed various Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and compare the variables.
- Experimented with different Machine Learning algorithms, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Bagging, and Boosting.
- Compared the results to recommend the best Machine learning model.
